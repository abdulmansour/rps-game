# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Testing object-oriented programming, linked-list pointer manipulation, dynamically allocated memory, parent/abstract class implementation, operator overloading, polymorphism and virtual functions.

Robot logic(not ai): 

The first strategy is the countertactic. Let's say you played scissors and your opponent played rock. The chance that your opponent will confidently play rock again is now very high. What that means to you: anticipate that and play paper. In other words: play the option that wasn't played in the previous round.

The second strategy is to mirror. If you just won, play what your opponent just played, because he or she will think that you are going to play the same gesture again.

If tie, simply play as if first move.
